Barriers to access.

00:00:01.640 --> 00:00:05.000
So when I have all the things
that I need to be able to do my job,

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.080
I say to people
all the time, I'm not blind at home,

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:09.360
I'm not visually impaired at home.
I don't have a disability at home.

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:14.720
I can go about my life and
just get on with things, whatever that is.

00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:17.080
So it's frustrating
when you step out your front door.

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:19.440
That then you've got like a
a backpack that you put on.

00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:22.880
You're like, well, I'm a problem
or this is going to be an issue.

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:25.080
So if you get everything right,

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:28.040
there actually is no issue

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:31.080
and you feel normal and fine
and engaged in the world.

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:34.360
And then your first world problem can be
where do we get a cup of coffee?

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:38.440
Or, you know, it
could be those normal things rather than

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:41.560
how am I going to navigate there?
